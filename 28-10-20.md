# 1. test instruction
`test` instruction computes the bitwise logical AND of first operand and second operand [1].

# 2. result of compiling empty C program with GCC
`int main(void) { return 0; }`
is compiled to following instructions (not optimized, Intel flavor):
```
main:
  push rbp
  mov rbp,rsp
  mov eax,0
  pop rbp
  ret
```

# 3. adding unused variable
```
int main(void){
  int a;
  return 0;
}
```
is compiled to exactly the same instructions as in (2).

# 4. setting intel flavor in gdb
before run `set disassembly-flavor intel`

# 5. show assembly code in gdb
`layout asm`

# 6. show values of registers in dgb
`layout regs`

# 7. incrementing unused variable
after compiling following code
```
int main(void){
  int a;
  ++a;
  return 0;
}
```
One instruction `add DWORD PTR -4[rbp], 1` is added to output
```
main:
  push rbp
  mov rbp,rsp
  add DWORD PTR -4[rbp],1
  mov eax,0
  pop rbp
  ret
```
