# test instruction
`test` instruction computes the bitwise logical AND of first operand and second operand [1].

# result of compiling empty C program with GCC
`int main(void) { return 0; }`
is compiled to following instructions (intel flavor):
```
main:
  push rbp
  mov rbp,rsp
  mov eax,0
  pop rbp
  ret
```
